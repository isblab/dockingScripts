This folder contains executables and source code for calculating:

1. PIE score : residue potential
2. PISA energy : atomic potential
3. HBNN : hydrogen bond potential from neural networks

You first need to make sure that executables in these three subfolders are working properly. 
Look at subdirectories for information on how to obtain these individual energies for a given model.

This folder also contains a wrapper script to obtain the total energy of a given model.
The total energy can be obtained like this:

sh <path to totalEnergy.sh> <modelpdb> <model receptor chain> <model ligand chain>
sh totalEnergy.sh m0.pdb A B 

Important! 
Make sure to set the scripts directly correctly in totalEnergy.sh
