The current folder contains:
pisa.params: The list of parameters for the PISA potential in double precision. 

pisaEnergy.c: The C source code for a program that calculates the PISA energy of a given structure. It also takes the parameters file as command line argument.

An executable of this code has been compiled for Linux using GCC,like this:
gcc -lm pisaEnergy.c -o pisaEnergy_linux 

Once compiled, it can be run like this:
./pisaEnergy_linux path_to_pdb_file receptor_chain_list ligand_chain_list params_file

Note that multiple chains in receptor or ligand protein are writted as a single string. 
e.g. if we want to score a model m0.pdb wwhose receptor contains chains A and B and ligand has chain C, we write:
./pisaEnergy_linux m0.pdb AB C pisa.params
