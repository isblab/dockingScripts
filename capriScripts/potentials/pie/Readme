PIE Residue Potential for Protein-Protein Docking
Copyright, DVS Ravikant and Ron Elber, 2011

How to install PIE?
1. Go to the pie/src folder
2. Use the makefile, Makefile.pie and do a make clean like this:
make clean -f Makefile.pie
3. Then compile the executable and required object files
make -f Makefile.pie

If this is done successfully, you should get an executable, pie_score, in the pie/bin folder. 

NOTE:
PIE is written in C++, so you can compile it with any C++ compiler.(default is G++). To change the default, go to the makefile, Makefil.pie and change the value of CC. 

How to run PIE?
1. Make sure to set the environment variable PIEDOCK_HOME to point to the location of the pie folder.
Add a line like this to your .bashrc (or equivalent) initialization script. 
export PIEDOCK_HOME=/location/to/pie/dir

2. PIE is simply run like this:
/location/to/pie/dir/bin/pie_score <complex_PDB> <receptor_chain> <ligand_chain> <location of PIE parameters file>

The PIE parameters file can be found in the pie/bin directory (called pie.params)

e.g. /h2/shruthi/pie/bin/pie_score complex_22.pdb A D /h2/shruthi/pie/bin/pie.params

NOTE:
Multiple receptor/ligand chains should be entered as a single string. 
e.g. if the complex, complex_1.pdb has receptor chains A and B and ligand chains C and D, call PIE like this

/h2/shruthi/pie/bin/pie_score complex_1.pdb AB CD /h2/shruthi/pie/bin/pie.params 

Testing PIE
In the example folder there are 5 PDB files, a pie.commands file and pie.energy file. 
Running the commands in the pie.commands file should produce for you the pie.energy file.
