Installation

Dependencies:
1. Cmake http://www.cmake.org/
2. FANN (Fast Artificial Neural Network) http://leenissen.dk/

Note that to run the hydrogen bond energy we first need to install FANN, the neural net library.
For this we need cmake binary for the appropriate OS.
Both these come bundled with the hydrogen bond code, but can be downloaded and installed separately. 

Steps for installing:
1. Download/install cmake binaries for your OS.
If your system is of type Linux 64 bit, then download the binary for cmake-2.8.12.2-Linux-i386 from the Cmake website.
You should have the executable cmake-2.8.12.2-Linux-i386/bin/cmake

Here onwards we assume that cmake is currently setup in the subdirectory cmake-2.8.12.2-Linux-i386, of the current directory where the hydrogen bond code is present. 

2. Go to fann-source subdirectory and run cmake with your choice of install prefix. 
../cmake-2.8.12.2-Linux-i386/bin/cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=$HOME/bin/include .

3. In same fann-source directory type
make install

This should install FANN on your system.

4. Compile hydrogen bond code using FANN libraries, for example using G++ compiler
g++ -Ifann-source/src/ -Ifann-source/src/include/ -lm -O3 hbeneNN.cpp -o hbnn

This should give the executable hbnn which can be run as shown below.

Note that the hbeneNN.cpp file should contain the location of FANN files in its header:
#include "fann-source/src/floatfann.c"
#include "fann-source/src/include/fann_cpp.h"

*****************************************************************************************************
Usage

The current folder contains:
hbnet.params: The topology and parameters for the neural network. 

hbeneNN.cpp: The C++ source code for a program that calculates the hydrogen bond energy from neural networks, for a given structure. It also takes the parameters file as command line argument.

An executable of this code has been compiled for Linux using G++,like this:
g++ hbeneNN.cpp -o hbnn 

Once compiled, it can be run like this:
./hbnn path_to_pdb_file receptor_chain_list ligand_chain_list params_file

Note that multiple chains in receptor or ligand protein are writted as a single string. 
e.g. if we want to score a model m0.pdb wwhose receptor contains chains A and B and ligand has chain C, we write:
./hbnn  m0.pdb AB C hbnet.params
